Cyber Security Team Project
Overview
This Python-based Port Guardian Utility empowers security analysts, network administrators, and penetration testers to automate the detection of weaknesses in target systems. By integrating nmap for port discovery, socket for service identification, and Exploit-DB for vulnerability matching, it streamlines the process of identifying open ports, exposed services, and associated security risks. 

Features
Automated Port Scanning: Discovers accessible services across user-defined or default port ranges (1-1024) via efficient nmap integration.

Service Banner Extraction: Retrieves critical version/service from open ports using lightweight socket connections.

Vulnerability Correlation: Cross-references service banners with Exploit-DB to highlight known CVEs and public exploits.

Actionable Reporting: Generates clear console summaries and exports machine-readable JSON files detailing ports, services, banners, and vulnerabilities.
