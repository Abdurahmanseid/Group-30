<strong>Digital Protection Hub</strong>

Digital Protection Hub is an all-in-one security platform designed to help identify, analyze, and respond to potential cyber threats. It combines six key tools in one place: a Firewall Log Monitor for detecting suspicious activity, a Port Scanner powered by Nmap to find open ports and services, a Malware Scanner that checks files against VirusTotalâ€™s database, a Password Strength Checker to evaluate security based on complexity and common patterns, a Software Inventory Checker to identify outdated or vulnerable applications, and an IP Geolocation & Reputation Checker that uses ip-api.com to pinpoint the physical location of an IP and AbuseIPDB to assess its malicious activity history. For example, scanning IP 203.0.113.45 may reveal from ip-api.com that it is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by DigitalOcean, LLC, while AbuseIPDB shows a confidence score of 85 (high risk) with 24 reports for port scanning and brute-force attacks
